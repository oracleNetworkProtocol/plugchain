# Install

Take Centos as an example:

Dependent tools
- git
- make
- gcc
- wget

```shell
yum install make gcc git wget
```

## Install `go`

::: tip
**Go 1.16+** is required for building and installing the Plug Chain Hub software.
:::

Install `go` (>=1.16) by following the [official docs](https://golang.org/doc/install). 

Remember to set your `$GOPATH`, `$GOBIN`, and `$PATH` environment variables, for example:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/go/bin
echo "export GOPATH=$HOME/go" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo "export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify that `go` has been installed successfully

```bash
go version
```

## Install `plugchaind`

After setting up `go` correctly, you should be able to compile and run `plugchaind`.

Make sure that your server can access to google.com because our project depends on some libraries provided by google. (If you are not able to access google.com, you can also try to add a proxy: `export GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io` or `export GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oracleNetworkProtocol/plugchain.git
cd plugchain
git checkout v1.1.0
make install
```

If your environment variables have set up correctly, you should not get any errors by running the above commands.
Now check your `plugchaind` version.

```bash
plugchaind version
```
