# Introduction

## Plug Chain Network

The *Plug Chain*  network is an internet of blockchains intended to provide a technology foundation that facilitates construction of distributed business applications.

The *Plug Chain*  network is part of the larger Cosmos network -- all zones in the network would be able to interact with any other zone in the Cosmos network over the standard IBC protocol.  We will provide an innovative solution that supports a whole new business scenario by introducing a layer of service semantics into the network, increasing the scale and diversity of the Cosmos network.

## Plug Chain 

At the "center" of the *Plug Chain*  network is a blockchain known as the *Plug Chain Hub*, which is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Cosmos SDK and Tendermint.  It will be the first regional hub to connect the Cosmos Hub.  The *Plug Chain*  hub is equipped with a service protocol that coordinates on-chain transaction processing with off-chain data processing and business logic execution.  We have also enhanced the IBC protocol to facilitate cross-chain invocation of those off-chain services, if so desired.

The service protocol and enhanced IBC protocol could eventually be contributed back into Cosmos SDK, allowing SDK users to develop blockchains that are compatible with the *Plug Chain*  network.

Client-facing, programming language specific SDKs will also be available to make it easy to provide and consume off-chain services within the *Plug Chain*  network.

## Plug Chain Tokens

The Plug Chain hub has its own native token,called Plug Cahin,which serves three functions in the network.

* **Staking.**  Similar to the ATOM token in the Cosmos Hub, the *Plug Chain*  token will be used as a staking token to protect the safe operation of the PoS blockchain.

* **Transaction Fee.**  The *Plug Chain*  token will also be used to pay fees for all transactions in the *Plug Chain*  network.

* **Service Fee.**  It is required that service providers in the *Plug Chain*  network charge service fees denominated in the *Plug Chain*  token.

Plug Chain network will eventually support all whitelisted fee tokens from the Cosmos network, which can be used to pay the transaction fees and service fees.
